# Liquid-Liquid phase separation in confined volumes, thermodynamics and dynamics

This repository hosts the notebook and data used to compare the nucleation rates of NaCl(aq), the comparison is discussed in: 

- Theoretical and computational approaches to study crystal nucleation from solution, Aaron R. Finney, Matteo Salvalaglio, submitted.
